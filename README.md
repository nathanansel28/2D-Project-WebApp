# GANTT.: An Operations Scheduling Web App
Access a preview of our project here (read-only): https://nathanansel28.github.io/40.014-ESA-webapp/

## About GANTT.
Our web application is designed to help manufacturing companies optimise their assembly line scheduling. By incorporating heuristic methods, we aim to create an intuitive and efficient tool that addresses the complexities of large-scale scheduling. Our solution focuses on minimising makespan, time complexity, WIP cost, and/or number of tardy jobs. Ultimately, producing a schedule that can match the needs of all businesses, and enhance their productivity.

This project was built using these technologies.
- React.js
- Node.js
- AntDesign
- VsCode
- MUI
- timelines-charts

2. In the server directory, run `env\Scripts\activate`

3. Virtual env (env) should be created. Run `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload`

4. Uvicorn should be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000]

  4. `.\env\Scripts\activate`
  5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Front End

1. Open a new terminal, ensure that your directory is in the frontend folder. (do `cd frontend` )

1. Installation: `npm install`
